# Exercise 2: Addition
The goal of this exercise is to make a small assembly function which adds the 2 numbers fed as
parameters. The C file tests the asm code.

The `.asm` file now contains a prologue and epilogue. All of your functions should do that from now
on!

## Things you probably want to search
- Function prologue & epilogue
- The stack frame
- Function parameters
- x86 addition
