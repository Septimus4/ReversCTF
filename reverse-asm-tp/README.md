# TP x86 ASM
Assembly exercises to get back into it

## Prerequisites
- Have `make`, `nasm` and `gcc` installed.

## Should I take this TP?
If you have to ask the question, you probably do.

This TP will refresh your memory on some x86 assembly basics like the basic operators, function prologue/epilogue, function call standards, stack stuff etc. Much googling will be involved, but i will provide a framework so you have to google a little bit less.

Note that we teach assembly in the Intel syntax because it is much more readable. You're free to do exercises in the AT&T syntax but if we're confused when you ask us for help, don't say we didn't warn you.

## Where do I start?
Each folder is an exercise, you start at `1` and work from there. You can skip any exercise, they are not dependent on each other files-wise, but **every exercise assumes you know everything there was to learn** in the previous one(s)!
