# Exercise 1: Return value
You've been provided with a makefile which will compile `main.c` and `main.asm`.

The goal of this exercise is to make a small assembly function which returns the value `42`.

The `.asm` file in particular is pretty heavily commented so don't hesitate to go through it line by line at your own pace. Anything after a `;` is a comment, don't forget!
