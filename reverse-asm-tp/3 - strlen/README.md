# Exercise 3: strlen
The goal of this exercise is to make a small assembly function which returns the length of a
null-terminated string passed as argument.

This exercise is when a lot of you might start to have trouble so don't hesitate to use gdb along
with a plug-in like pwndbg to make your lives easier! I do NOT recommend using the "putchar method"
because you're just going to change your function a lot to print characters!

## Things you probably want to search
- Dereferencing 
- Loops
- gdb
